.. _chapter_6:

Conformance
===========

The CDA specification section 1.3 provides conformance requirements for
Document Originators and Document Recipients.

.. note::

   1. Consolidated CDA Implementation Guide Section 2.8 includes
      recommended best practices for Document Recipients displaying CDA
      documents.

   2. There may be other CDA-related standards to which an application
      may claim conformance. For example, IHE Patient Care Coordination
      Technical Framework specifies a Document Consumer actor with four
      options for conformance.

A CDA document instance in accordance with this Standard asserts its
conformance to a template by inclusion of the specified templateID
elements in the document, sections, and entries.
