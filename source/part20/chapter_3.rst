Definitions
===========

For the purposes of this Standard the following definitions apply.

Context Group
   A set of coded concepts defined by a Mapping Resource forming a set
   appropriate to use in a particular context.

Context ID
   Identifier of a Context Group.

Template
   A pattern that describes the Content Items, Value Types, Relationship
   Types and Value Sets that may be used in part of a Structured Report
   content tree, or in other Content Item constructs, such as
   Acquisition Context or Protocol Context. Analogous to a Module of an
   Information Object Definition.

Template ID
   Identifier of a Template.

Coding Schemes
   Dictionaries (lexicons) of concepts (terms) with assigned codes and
   well defined meanings.

Concept Domain
   A named category of like concepts (a semantic type) that is specified
   in the vocabulary declaration of an attribute in an information
   model. It constrains the intent of the coded element while deferring
   the binding of the element to a specific set of codes until later in
   the specification process.

Value Set
   A uniquely identifiable set of valid concept identifiers. Value sets
   constrain the permissible content for a coded element in an
   information model or data type specification.

Vocabulary Binding
   The mechanism of identifying specific codes to be used to express the
   semantics of coded model elements in information models or coded data
   type properties. Vocabulary Binding may bind the coded element or
   data type property to a single fixed value code, or may bind it to a
   Value Set Assertion.

Template
   A set of conformance statements which further constrain an existing
   information model.

Business Name
   Identifier for a CDA Data Element, Attribute, or structure of Data
   Elements that corresponds to a business requirement for information
   exchange.
