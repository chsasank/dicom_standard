Scope and Field of Application
==============================

This Part of the DICOM Standard specifies templates for the encoding of
imaging reports using the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture Release 2
(CDA R2, or simply CDA) Standard. Within this scope are clinical
procedure reports for specialties that use imaging for screening,
diagnostic, or therapeutic purposes.

This Part constitutes an implementation guide for CDA, and is harmonized
with the approach to standardized templates for CDA implementation
guides developed by HL7. It also provides Business Names for data
elements that link data in user terminology, e.g., collected by a report
authoring application, to specific CDA encoded elements.

As an implementation guide for imaging reports, particular attention is
given to the use and reference of data collected in imaging procedures
as explicit evidence within reports. This data includes images,
waveforms, measurements, annotations, and other analytic results managed
as DICOM SOP Instances. Specifically, this Part includes a specification
for transformation into CDA documents of DICOM Structured Report
instances that represent imaging reports.
