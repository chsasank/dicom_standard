Conformance Statement Example Print Server (Informative)
========================================================

Disclaimer:

This document is a sample DICOM Conformance Statement for a fictional
Print Server (SCP) Management System, called
EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT (also called Print Server) produced by a
fictional vendor called EXAMPLE-IMAGING-PRODUCTS.

As stated in the annex title, this document is truly informative, and
not normative. A conformance statement of an actual product might
implement additional services and options as appropriate for its
specific purpose. In addition, an actual product might implement the
services described in a different manner and, for example, with
different characteristics and/or sequencing of activities. In other
words, this conformance statement example does not intend to standardize
a particular manner that a product might implement DICOM functionality.

Conformance Statement Overview
------------------------------

This fictional product EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT implements the
necessary DICOM services to facilitate the Print (SCP) Imaging
Management in the healthcare departments, managing Print imaging over a
network on Medical Laser Imaging Systems. It enables the capabilities to
capture images at any networked DICOM modality and then print them
anywhere they're needed in the medical facility.

Furthermore, before sending the images to be printed the
EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT will apply image processing, using
presentation parameters and LUT to improve the image presentation
quality and consistency. Moreover, it will manage the printing
presentation format and the Printer queue and Configuration.

`table_title <#table_E.1-1>`__ provides an overview of the network
services supported by EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT.

Additional Remarks for This Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document is a sample DICOM Conformance Statement created for DICOM
. It is to be used solely as an example to illustrate how to create a
DICOM Conformance Statement for a print server system supporting DICOM
Print Services. The subject of the document,
EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT, is a fictional product.

Implementation Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sect_E.4.1.1:

Application Data Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This implementation model uses the DICOM Basic Print Management Meta SOP
Class to receive studies for the Medical Imager. Multiple associations
to Print SCUs are supported.

The Print Server is receiving the Images with the Presentation and
Annotation information, it Apply it on the images and creates a
print-job within the print queue, containing one or more film pages
composed from images selected by the client Print SCU. Furthermore, it
also manages the Printer Status and Configuration.

.. _sect_E4.1.2:

Functional Definition of AEs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _sect_E.4.1.2.1:

Functional Definition of Print Server (SCP) Application Entity
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Print Server System acquires the images with the demographics and
presentation information from the connected Print Composer (SCU) that is
Grouped with a Workstation or an Archive device. Studies are temporarily
stored on disk. The images are then processed and formatted and finally
queued as a print job on the Printer queue. If the Printer is operating
normally, then the film sheets described in the print-job will be
printed. Changes in the Printer operation status will be detected (e.g.,
film Magazine empty) and reported back to the Print SCU. If the Printer
is not operating normally, then the print-job will be set to an error
state and can be restarted by the user via the job control interface.

The Print Server Management includes:

-  DICOM Association and Negotiation Management

-  Image Buffering

-  Image Processing (Windowing level, P-LUT, GSDF, Annotation, etc)

-  Image Formatting (Film sheet format)

-  Printing

-  Print Job Status Tracking

-  Print Status Tracking

-  Printer Configuration Tracking

The Printer Status and Configuration can be requested at any time by the
Print SCU, while the Print Server will update the Print SCU
asynchronously whenever the Printer status get changed. Furthermore, the
Print Server provides in addition a Service operation of checking the
networking connectivity to it's Print SCU using the Verification SOP
Class.

   Print Server Management Sequence

.. note::

   1. The Print Job N-GET and N-EVENT-REPORT are Asynchronous messages
      that may occur at any time after the Print Job was created.

   2. The Printer Status & Configuration N-GET and the N-EVENT-REPORT
      are Asynchronous messages that may occur at any time it is needed
      during the Print sequence.

The Print Server Management workflow activities in the sequence order as
described in `figure_title <#figure_E.4.1-2>`__ apply:

1.  DICOM Film Session N-CREATE

2.  DICOM Presentation LUT N-CREATE

3.  DICOM Film Box N-CREATE

4.  Create Image Boxes & Annotation Boxes

5.  DICOM Image Box N-SET

6.  DICOM Annotation Box N-SET

7.  DICOM Film Session N-ACTION, A print job is created for each Film
    Session N-action.

8.  DICOM Film Box N-ACTION, A print job is created for each Film Box
    N-action.

9.  Create Print Job

10. DICOM Film Session N-DELETE.

The following additional activities are asynchronous mode and they can
be send any time the Print Server is up and running:

\* DICOM Print Job N-GET, request the execution status of a Print Job.

\* DICOM Print Job N-EVENT-REPORT, report an update on the execution
status of a Print Job.

\*\* DICOM Printer Status N-GET - Request a Printer Status, anytime the
Printer is ON.

\*\* DICOM Printer Configuration N-GET - Request the Printer
configuration, anytime the Printer is ON.

\*\* DICOM Printer Status N-EVENT-REPORT - Report the Printer Status
Changed.

Description and Sequencing of Activities
                                        

A remote peer DICOM Application Entity, acting as an Print SCU,
establishes an association with the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT that
accepts these Associations for the purpose of receiving images and image
presentation related data for image processing and printing on a hard
copy medium.

When an association has been established the Sequencing of Real-World
Activities is as described in `Sequencing of Real-World
Activities <#sect_E.4.1.3>`__.

The Print Server (SCP) AE may reject association attempts as shown in
`table_title <#table_E.4.2-9>`__. The Result, Source and Reason/Diag
columns represent the values returned in the appropriate fields of an
ASSOCIATE-RJ PDU (see ). The contents of the Source column is
abbreviated to save space and the meaning of the abbreviations are:

The receipt of the N-ACTION will result in submitting a print job to
print all the films of the film session in the order that they were
received. The Film Session N-ACTION arguments are defined in the DICOM
Standard . The number of films that can be stored for print is limited
by the size of the Printer's installed disk space and the number of
images sent by the connected Print SCU simultaneously.

the N-ACTION of a specific Film Session is described in the following

.. note::

   1. See the addition value "CURRENT" in `Standard Extended Basic Film
      Session SOP Class <#sect_E.8.5.1>`__

   2. Annotation Display Format Id1 - instructs the Print Server
      Management System to create annotation boxes and set the format of
      the annotation boxes. The currently loaded machine resident font
      will be used. See table below.

   3. Smoothing Type - If Magnification Type is CUBIC, this attribute
      allows the SCU to specify the various smoothing effects provided
      by the interpolation algorithm in the Laser Imager. 0 specifies
      replicate, and 1 through 15 specifies various levels of smoothing.

   4. Border Density - allows the density of the areas surrounding and
      between images on the film to be either dark or white.

   5. Trim - specifies whether a trim box be printed around each image
      on film. The trim density is the opposite of the border density.

The following table describes the annotation formats are supported:

.. note::

   1. Smoothing Type 2- If Magnification Type is CUBIC, this attribute
      allows the SCU to specify the various smoothing effects provided
      by the interpolation algorithm in the Laser Imager. 0 specifies
      replicate, and 1 through 15 specifies various levels of smoothing.

   2. Border Density 3- allows the density of the areas surrounding and
      between images on the film to be either dark or white.

   3. Trim4 - specifies whether a trim box be printed around each image
      on film. The trim density is the opposite of the border density.

the N-SET of a specific Film Box is described in the following table:

.. note::

   1. Max Rows and Columns - The Maximum number of printable pixel
      matrix per supported Media size

   2. Magnification Type - Same as the attribute Magnification Type in
      Film Box, but used here for image based setting. If not specified,
      the value of this attribute inherits from Magnification Type in
      Film Box.

   3. Smoothing Type - If Magnification Type was cubic, this attribute
      allows the Laser Imager interpolation algorithm to be further
      defined.

   4. See the addition value in `Standard Extended Basic Film Session
      SOP Class <#sect_E.8.5.1>`__

Specific Conformance for Printer SOP Class
                                          

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT supports the following DIMSE
operations and notifications for the Printer SOP Class:

-  N-GET

-  N-EVENT-REPORT

Details of the supported attributes and status-handling behavior are
described in the following subsections.

.. _sect_E.4.2.1.4.1.3.2.4.1:

Specific Conformance for Printer N-GET Status
                                             

The Print SCU uses the Printer SOP Class N-GET operation to obtain
information about the current Printer status. The attributes obtained
via N-GET are listed in the table below.

The following tables (listing attributes are sent by the SCP) use a
number of abbreviations. The abbreviations used in the "Presence of
Value" column are:

VNAP: Value Not Always Present (attribute sent zero length if no value
is present)

ANAP: Attribute Not Always Present

ALWAYS: Always Present

EMPTY: Attribute is sent without a value

NS: Not supported - attribute is not being sent

Specific Conformance to Basic Annotation Box SOP Class
                                                      

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT creates the Basic Annotation Box SOP
instance at the time the Basic Film Box SOP instance is created, based
on the value of the attribute Annotation Display Format ID (2010,0030)
of the Basic Film Box.

The created Basic Annotation Box SOP instance can be updated with the
N-SET DIMSE service. The following table describes the attributes that
can be updated:

If the Event Type is Failure or Pending then the error/pending condition
is sent to the SCU through the Execution Status Info element
(2100,0030), as described in `table_title <#table_E.4.2-35>`__.

When the Event Type is Done or Printing the Print Server is deleting the
Print Job SOP Instance after receiving a confirmation from the Print
SCU.

Specific Conformance for Print Job N-GET
                                        

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT support the Print Job N-GET
requests. When a Print SCU needs to monitor the status of a print job,
it can either maintain its association until the Print Server Management
System notifies the SCU that the print job has completed, or it may open
a new association with the Print Server Management System to track the
print job using the Print Job SOP Class N-GET status.

The following table describes the Print Server Management System
responds to a N-GET Print Job DIMSE Service request and returns the
following attributes in support of Print Job SOP Class.

Specific Conformance for Presentation LUT Box SOP Class
                                                       

The Print Server Management System supports the Presentation LUT SOP
class as SCP. Print SCU may negotiate this support and create a
Presentation LUT instance prior to the creation of Film Boxes or Image
Boxes. Multiple Presentation LUT instances are supported in an
association, but only one instance will be supported for each image.

The SCU shall send either Presentation LUT Sequence or the Presentation
LUT Shape. These values are mutually exclusive and the action will
result in an error if neither or both are present. The presence of the
Presentation LUT instance overrides any Data Set in the Configuration
Information attribute (2010,0150) of the Film Box or Image Box.

The Print Server Management System provides support for the following
DIMSE Services:

-  N-CREATE

-  N-DELETE

.. _sect_E.4.2.1.4.1.3.5.1:

Presentation LUT Box SOP Class Operation for N-CREATE

the

Presentation LUT Box SOP Class Operation for N-Delete
                                                     

When a N-DELETE DIMSE service is requested with a specific Presentation
LUT SOP instance, the Print Server Management System will not delete the
specified Presentation LUT SOP instance as long as there are outstanding
references to it. Otherwise, it deletes the specified Presentation LUT
SOP instance.

Consistent Presentation of Grayscale Images
                                           

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT supports the DICOM standard ()
Grayscale Standard Display Function (GSDF) for Consistent Presentation
of Displayed and Printed Images. The Image Consistency is achieved
through the support of the Presentation LUT (transforming the image
pixels value in to the Standard Presentation P-values) and then
Transforming the Image pixel values from the standard Presentation
(P-value) space to the Optical Density space. Calibrating the Imager
Printer Device to adjust the Printer Imager characteristic curve to fit
the GSDF curve. The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT Service Manual
describes in details the Imager Printer calibration to the DICOM GSDF
curve.

Network Interfaces
------------------

.. _sect_E.4.3.1:

Physical Network Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT supports a single network interface.
One of the following physical network interfaces will be available
depending on installed hardware options:

.. table:: Supported Physical Network Interfaces

   +-------------------+
   | Ethernet 100baseT |
   +-------------------+
   | Ethernet 10baseT  |
   +-------------------+

.. _sect_E.4.3.2:

Additional Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DHCP can be used to obtain TCP/IP network configuration information
(e.g., own TCP/IP address, net-mask, default gateway, DNS server, etc).
Support for DHCP can be configured via the Configuration
Service/Installation Tool. . If DHCP is not in use, TCP/IP network
configuration information can be manually configured via the
Service/Installation Tool.

DNS can be used for address resolution. If DHCP is not in use, the
identity of a DNS server can be configured via the Service/Installation
Tool. If a DNS server is not in use, local mapping between hostname and
TCP/IP address can be manually configured via the Service/Installation
Tool.

.. _sect_E.4.3.3:

IPv4 and IPv6 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This product supports both IPv4 and IPv6. It does not utilize any of the
optional configuration identification or security features of IPv6.

.. _sect_E.4.4:

Configuration

.. _sect_E.4.4.1:

AE Title/Presentation Address Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sect_E4.4.1.1:

Local AE Titles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All local applications use the AETs and TCP/IP Ports configured via the
Service/Installation Tool. The Field Service Engineer can configure the
IP Address via the Service/Installation Tool. No Default AE Titles are
provided. The AE Titles must be configured during installation. The
local AET used by each individual application can be configured
independently of the AET used by other local applications. If so
configured, all local AEs are capable of using the same AET.

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT is configured via the Configuration
Service/Installation Tool as follows

.. table:: AE Title Configuration Table

   ================== ================== ===================
   Application Entity Default AE Title   Default TCP/IP Port
   ================== ================== ===================
   PRINT-SCP          Must be configured 104
   ================== ================== ===================

.. _sect_E.4.4.1.2:

Remote AE Title/Presentation Address Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AET, host names and port numbers of remote applications are
configured using the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT
Service/Installation Tool.

.. _sect_E.4.4.1.2.1:

Print Server Management
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT Service/Installation tool must be
used to set the AETs, port-numbers, host-names, Local Network Host Name,
Router Address(Gateway), Sub-net Mask, IP-addresses (if no DHCP is used)
and other capabilities for the remote Print SCUs. Multiple remote Print
SCUs can be defined.

.. _sect_E.4.4.2:

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

A large number of parameters related to Print Management, Communications
and general operation can be configured using the Service/Installation
Tool. The following table shows those configuration parameters relevant
to DICOM communication. See the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT
Configuration Service Manual for details on general configuration
capabilities.

IOD Contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sect_E.8.1.1:

Created IOD Instance(s)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT creates the following IOD types of
instances: Image Boxes, Annotation Boxes, Print Jobs, Printer, and
Printer Configuration.

The attributes of the created IODs are described in the SOP Specific
Conformance, `SOP Specific Conformance <#sect_E.4.2.1.4.1.3>`__.

.. _sect_E.8.1.2:

Usage of Attributes From Received IODs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The usage of attributes received in the IODs sent by the Print SCU is
described in the SOP Specific Conformance, `SOP Specific
Conformance <#sect_E.4.2.1.4.1.3>`__.

.. _sect_E.8.1.3:

Attribute Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following table is a mapping table of attributes that can be set by
different Print IODs. If more then one IOD is setting the same element,
then the value will be over-written by the IOD's value in the order from
left to right, such that the Printer Configuration (PC) specific element
values (as described in the mapping table #45) is in lowest order might
be overwritten by any other IOD.

Print Management IODs Abbreviations

PC - Printer Configuration

FS - Film Session

FB - Film Box

IB - Image Box

PI - Printer Information

PJ - Print Job

The IODs in the above table are in the order from Left to Right
over-writing values that are already set by previous IODs. For Example:
the Print Priority element can be set by both the Film Session and the
Print Job, however if both IODs are setting this values then the Print
Job Print Priority value will over write the Film Session Print Priority
value.

.. _sect_E.8.1.4:

Coerced/Modified Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT AE will truncate attribute values
received from the Print Composer (SCU) if the value length is longer
than the maximum length permitted by the attribute VR.

Standard Extended / Specialized / Private SOP Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sect_E.8.5.1:

Standard Extended Basic Film Session SOP Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT is making the following extensions
to DICOM SOP Classes:

**SOP Class**: Basic Film Session SOP

**Attribute**: Film Destination (2000,0040)

**Extensions value**: CURRENT

This extension allows the SCU to print on the destination currently
configured at the printer.

**SOP Class**: Basic Film Session SOP

**Attribute**: Medium Type (2000,2000)

**Extensions**: CURRENT

This extension allows images to be printed on whatever media type is
currently loaded in the printer.

Note that if Medium Type is specified, and a media type other than that
requested is installed, then the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT will
return success (0x0) and will either queue the print job until the
correct media type is installed, or print on the media currently
installed, based on the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT configuration.
Specifying the Media Type to CURRENT will ensure that the print job will
always be printed.

If Medium Type is not specified, then the default CURRENT will be used,
allowing images to always be printed.

.. _sect_E.8.5.2:

Standard Extended Basic Film Box SOP Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**SOP Class**: Basic Film Box SOP

**Attribute**: Film Size (2010,2010)

**Extensions**: CURRENT

This extension allows images to be printed on whatever film size is
currently loaded in the printer.

Note that if Film Size is specified, and a size other than that
requested is installed, the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT will return
success (0x0), and will either queue the print job until the correct
sized film is installed or print on the media currently installed, based
on the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT configuration. Specifying the
Film Size to CURRENT will ensure that the print job will always be
printed.

If Film Size is not specified, then the default CURRENT will be used,
allowing images to always be printed.

.. _sect_E.8.5.3:

Standard Extended Basic Grayscale Image Box SOP Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**SOP Class**: Basic Grayscale Image Box SOP

**Attribute**: Bits Stored (0028,0028)

**Extensions**: 8-16 bits stored are supported.

DICOM only specifies 8 and 12 for number of bits stored. The
EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT supports the number of bits stored to be
from 8 through 16 bits.

**SOP Class**: Basic Grayscale Image Box SOP

**Attribute**: High Bit (0028,0028)

**Extensions**: High Bit positions 7 - 15 are supported.

DICOM specifies that the high bit must be the 7th or 11th bit (for 8 or
12 bits stored, respectively). The EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT
supports the high bit to be the number of bits stored minus one. For
example, if the number of bits stored is 13, the high bit is 12.

.. _sect_E.8.6:

Private Transfer Syntaxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No Private Transfer Syntaxes is supported.
