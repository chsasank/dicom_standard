Conformance Statement Sample ImageViewer with Hanging Protocol Support (Informative)
====================================================================================

Disclaimer:

This document is an example DICOM Conformance Statement for a fictional
image display device for DICOM images and Hanging Protocol objects
obtained over the network.

As stated in the annex title, this document is truly informative, and
not normative. A conformance statement of an actual product might
implement additional services and options as appropriate for its
specific purpose. In addition, an actual product might implement the
services described in a different manner and, for example, with
different characteristics and/or sequencing of activities. In other
words, this conformance statement example does not intend to standardize
a particular manner that a product might implement DICOM functionality.

Conformance Statement Overview
------------------------------

The application supports accepting Images and Presentation States from
remote systems, and querying a remote system for Hanging Protocol
Instances that may then be retrieved to the local system. It also
supports sending locally loaded images and created Presentation State
and Hanging Protocol Instances across the network to remote systems.

Implementation Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sect_G.4.1.1:

Application Data Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The application provides both a user interface, internal database and
network listener that spawns additional threads as necessary to handle
incoming connections.

Conceptually the network services may be modeled as the following
separate AEs, though in fact all the AEs share a single (configurable)
AE Title:

-  STORAGE-SCP, which receives incoming Image, Presentation State, and
   Hanging Protocol Instances

-  STORAGE-SCU, which sends outbound Image, Presentation State, and
   Hanging Protocol Instances

-  FIND-SCU, which queries remote AEs for Hanging Protocol Instances

-  MOVE-SCU, which retrieves Hanging Protocol Instances

.. _sect_G.4.1.2:

Functional Definitions of AEs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _sect_G.4.1.2.1:

STORAGE-SCP
'''''''''''

STORAGE-SCP waits in the background for connections, will accept
associations with Presentation Contexts for SOP Classes of the Storage
Service Class and Hanging Protocol Storage Service Class, and will store
the received instances to the local database where they may subsequently
be listed and viewed through the user interface.

.. _sect_G.4.1.2.2:

STORAGE-SCU
'''''''''''

STORAGE-SCU is activated through the user interface when a user selects
instances from the local database, or the currently displayed instance,
and requests that they be sent to a remote AE (selected from a
pre-configured list).

.. _sect_G.4.1.2.3:

FIND-SCU
''''''''

FIND-SCU is activated in the background when images for a study are
received, to query for matching Hanging Protocols if an appropriate
Hanging Protocol Instance is not available in the local database.

.. _sect_G.4.1.2.4:

MOVE-SCU
''''''''

MOVE-SCU is activated in the background, to retrieve Hanging Protocol
Instances identified in the query results returned to the FIND-SCU. A
connection to the remote AE is established to initiate and monitor the
retrieval, and the STORAGE-SCP AE receives the retrieved instances.

.. _sect_G.4.1.3:

Sequencing of Real-World Activities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All SCP activities are performed asynchronously in the background and
not dependent on any sequencing.

Storage SCU activities are sequentially initiated in the user interface,
and another activity may not be initiated until the prior activity has
completed. Find and Move SCU activities are performed asynchronously in
the background, where Move activities are triggered by the results of
Find activities.

Extended Negotiation
                    

No extended negotiation is performed, though STORAGE-SCP:

-  is a Level 2 Storage SCP (Full - does not discard any data elements)

-  does not support digital signatures

-  does not coerce any received data elements

.. _sect_G.4.2.1.4.1.3:

SOP Specific Conformance
                        

.. _sect_G.4.2.1.4.1.3.1:

SOP Specific Conformance to Storage Service Class
                                                 

STORAGE-SCP provides standard conformance to the Storage Service Class.

When displaying an image in the viewing application, if a Hanging
Protocol Instance is not being applied or the instance being applied
does not contain presentation intent attributes, the newest Grayscale
Softcopy Presentation State containing references to the image will be
automatically applied, and the GSPS Presentation Label and Presentation
Description will be displayed. The user has the option to select any
other Presentation States that also reference the image. If no
Presentation State references the image then no Presentation State will
be applied by default. If a Hanging Protocol Instance is being applied,
the presentation intent attributes, if present, are used to select the
closest matching GSPS instance to apply. If there is no GSPS instance,
then the Hanging Protocol Instance presentation intent attributes are
applied, if present.

All of the Image Storage SOP Classes listed in
`table_title <#table_G.4.2-1>`__ are supported as references from
instances of the Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State Storage SOP
Class.

.. _sect_G.4.2.1.4.1.3.2:

SOP Specific Conformance to Hanging Protocol Storage Service Class
                                                                  

STORAGE-SCP provides standard conformance to the Hanging Protocol
Storage Service Class.

If Partial Data Display Handling (0072,0208) is zero length, then
MAINTAIN_LAYOUT behavior is applied. If the value is ADAPT_LAYOUT, then
Image Boxes are proportionally resized to occupy all available display
space.

If the display environment of a Hanging Protocol Instance differs from
the display environment of the ImageViewer, then the layout is
maintained.

The Hanging Protocol SOP instances are stored to a local database until
explicitly deleted. When a study is selected for display, the
application automatically applies a Hanging Protocol Instance to the
study.

.. _sect_G.4.2.1.4.1.3.3:

Presentation Context Acceptance Criterion
                                         

STORAGE-SCP will always accept any Presentation Context for the
supported SOP Classes with the supported Transfer Syntaxes. More than
one proposed Presentation Context will be accepted for the same Abstract
Syntax if the Transfer Syntax is supported, whether or not it is the
same as another Presentation Context.

.. _sect_G.4.2.1.4.1.3.4:

Transfer Syntax Selection Policies
                                  

STORAGE-SCP prefers explicit Transfer Syntaxes. If offered a choice of
Transfer Syntaxes in a Presentation Context, it will apply the following
priority to the choice of Transfer Syntax:

a. first encountered explicit Transfer Syntax,

b. default Transfer Syntax.

STORAGE-SCP will accept duplicate Presentation Contexts, that is, if it
is offered multiple Presentation Contexts, each of which offers
acceptable Transfer Syntaxes, it will accept all Presentation Contexts,
applying the same priority for selecting a Transfer Syntax for each.

.. _sect_G.4.2.1.4.1.3.5:

Response Status
               

STORAGE-SCP will behave as described in the Table below when generating
the C-STORE response command message.

STORAGE-SCU will propose Presentation Contexts only for the SOP Class of
the instance that is to be transferred.

For that SOP Class, STORAGE-SCU will propose multiple Presentation
Contexts, one for each of the supported Transfer Syntaxes, and an
additional Presentation Context with all of the supported Transfer
Syntaxes, in order to determine which Transfer Syntaxes the remote SCP
supports, and which it prefers.

STORAGE-SCU prefers explicit Transfer Syntaxes. If offered a choice of
Transfer Syntaxes in the accepted Presentation Contexts, it will apply
the following priority to the choice of Presentation Context to use for
the C-STORE operation:

a. first encountered explicit Transfer Syntax,

b. default Transfer Syntax.

MOVE-SCU will propose multiple Presentation Contexts, one for each of
the supported Transfer Syntaxes, and an additional Presentation Context
with all of the supported Transfer Syntaxes, in order to determine which
Transfer Syntaxes the remote SCP supports, and which it prefers.

SOP Specific Conformance to C-FIND SOP Classes
                                              

MOVE-SCU provides standard conformance to the supported C-MOVE SOP
Class.

No CANCEL requests are ever issued.

The retrieval is performed from the AE that was specified in the
Retrieve AE attribute returned from the query performed by FIND-SCU. The
instances are retrieved to the current application's local database by
specifying the destination as the AE Title of the STORE-SCP AE of the
local application. This implies that the remote C-MOVE SCP must be
preconfigured to determine the presentation address corresponding to the
STORE-SCP AE. The STORE-SCP AE will accept storage requests addressed to
it from anywhere, so no pre-configuration of the local application to
accept from the remote AE is necessary (except in so far as it was
necessary to configure FIND-SCU).

.. _sect_G.4.2.4.3.1.3.5:

Sub-Operation Dependent Behavior
                                

Since the C-MOVE operation is dependent on completion of C-STORE
sub-operations that are occurring on a separate association, the
question of failure of operations on the other association(s) must be
considered.

MOVE-SCU completely ignores whatever activities are taking place in
relation to the STORAGE-SCP AE that is receiving the retrieved
instances. Once the C-MOVE has been initiated it runs to completion (or
failure) as described in the C-MOVE response command message(s). There
is no attempt by MOVE-SCU to confirm that instances have actually been
successfully received or locally stored.

Whether or not completely or partially successfully retrievals are made
available in the local database to the user is purely dependent on the
success or failure of the C-STORE sub-operations, not on any explicit
action by MOVE-SCU.

Whether or not the remote AE attempts to retry any failed C-STORE
sub-operations is beyond the control of MOVE-SCU.

If the association on which the C-MOVE was issued is aborted for any
reason, whether or not the C-STORE sub-operations continue is dependent
on the remote AE; the local STORAGE-SCP will continue to accept
associations and storage operations regardless.

.. _sect_G.4.2.4.4:

Association Acceptance Policy
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

MOVE-SCU does not accept associations.

.. _sect_G.4.3:

Network Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sect_G.4.3.1:

Physical Network Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The application is indifferent to the physical medium over which TCP/IP
executes, which is dependent on the underlying operating system and
hardware.

.. _sect_G.4.3.2:

Additional Protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When host names rather than IP addresses are used in the configuration
properties to specify presentation addresses for remote AEs, the
application is dependent on the name resolution mechanism of the
underlying operating system.

.. _sect_G.4.3.3:

IPv4 and IPv6 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This product supports both IPv4 and IPv6. It does not utilize any of the
optional configuration identification or security features of IPv6.

.. _sect_G.4.4:

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All configuration is performed through the use of Java properties
file(s) stored in pre-defined locations that are specific to the
underlying operating system. Refer to the Release Notes for specific
details.

.. _sect_G.4.4.1:

AE Title/Presentation Address Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Calling AE Titles of the local application are configurable in the
preferences file. The mapping of the logical name by which remote AEs
are described in the user interface to Called AE Titles as well as
presentation address (hostname or IP address and port number) is
configurable in the preferences file.

.. _sect_G.4.4.2:

Parameters
