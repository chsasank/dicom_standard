Scope and Field of Application
==============================

This Part of the DICOM Standard specifies the set of Information Object
Definitions (IODs) that provide an abstract definition of real-world
objects applicable to communication of digital medical information. For
each IOD, this Part specifies:

-  any necessary information for the semantic description of the IOD

-  relationships to associated real-world objects relevant to the IOD

-  Attributes that describe the characteristics of the IOD

For each IOD, this Part does not specify:

-  the nature of any Service Class Definition intended to reference the
   IOD

-  the nature of any interactions that result in the usage of the IOD

This Part is related to other parts of the DICOM Standard in that:

-  PS3.4 Service Class Specifications, specifies application level
   services by grouping DIMSE services with IODs as defined in this
   Part;

-  PS3.5 Data Structure and Semantics, defines the data encoding used in
   the DIMSE Protocol when applied to IODs defined in this Part;

-  PS3.6 Data Dictionary, contains an index by Tag of all IOD Attributes
   defined in this Part. This index includes the Value Representation
   and Value Multiplicity for each Attribute;

-  PS3.7 Message Exchange Protocol, defines the DIMSE Services and
   Protocol that may be applied to IODs defined in this Part.
