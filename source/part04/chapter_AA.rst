Ophthalmic Refractive Measurements Storage SOP Classes (Normative)
==================================================================

.. _sect_AA.1:

Scope
-----

Refractive instruments are the most commonly used instruments in eye
care. At present many of them have the capability for digital output,
but their data is most often addressed by manual input into a paper or
electronic record. Lensometry, Autorefraction, Keratometry, Subjective
Refraction, and Visual Acuity Measurements Storage SOP Classes support
devices such as lensometers, auto-refractors, keratometers,
autophoropters, and autoprojectors.

.. _sect_AA.2:

Behavior of a SCP
-----------------

For a device that is both a SCU and a SCP of the aforementioned Storage
SOP Classes, in addition to the behavior for the Storage Service Class
specified in `Behavior of an SCP <#sect_B.2.2>`__, the following
additional requirements are specified for Structured Reporting Storage
SOP Classes:

-  A SCP of these SOP Class shall support Level 2 Conformance as defined
   in `Conformance as an SCP <#sect_B.4.1>`__.

.. note::

   This requirement means that all Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 Attributes
   defined in the Information Object Definition and Private Attributes
   associated with the SOP Class will be stored and may be accessed.
