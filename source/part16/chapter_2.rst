BI-RADS® Terminology and Nomenclature
-------------------------------------

A portion of the terminology used within the Mammography CAD SR SOP
Class and the Breast Imaging Report and Relevant Patient Information for
Breast Imaging Templates is derived from BI-RADS®, a copyrighted lexicon
of breast imaging terminology and nomenclature licensed by DICOM from
the American College of Radiology.

MQCM 1999 Terminology and Nomenclature
--------------------------------------

References to MQCM 1999 are made in the description of the Mammography
CAD SR SOP Class. In this MQCM 1999 refers to the Mammography Quality
Control Manual 1999, available from the American College of Radiology.
This document describes a standardized approach to mammographic
acquisition standards, patient positioning, and so on. The DICOM
Standard does not require Mammography CAD SR SOP Class implementations
to adhere to MQCM 1999.

.. _sect_2.4:

MQSA Terminology and Nomenclature
---------------------------------

References to MQSA are made in the description of the Mammography CAD SR
SOP Class. In this MQSA refers to the Mammography Quality Standards Act
final rules. While MQSA is a federal regulation of the United States
government, it provides the only widely published standards for
mammographic quality and is incorporated in this document for that
reason. The DICOM Standard does not require Mammography CAD SR SOP Class
implementations to adhere to MQSA.
