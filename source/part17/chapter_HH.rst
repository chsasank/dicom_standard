Segmentation Encoding Example (Informative)
===========================================

`figure_title <#figure_HH-1>`__ depicts an example of how the data is
organized within an instance of the Segmentation IOD. Each item in the
Segment Sequence provides the Attributes of a segment. The source image
used in all segmentations is referenced in the Shared Functional Groups
Sequence. Each item of the Per-frame Functional Groups Sequence maps a
frame to a segment. The Pixel Data classifies the corresponding
pixels/voxels of the source Image.
