This Annex was formerly located in in the 2003 and earlier revisions of
the Standard.

This Annex provides an explanation of how to use the patient orientation
data elements.

As for the hand, the direction labels are based on the foot in the
standard anatomic position. For the right foot, for example, RIGHT will

through movement or positioning of the extremity. This is also true of
the HEAD and FOOT directions.
