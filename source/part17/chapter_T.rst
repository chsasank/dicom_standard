Definition of Diameter Symmetry with Arterial Plaques
-----------------------------------------------------

The Diameter Symmetry of a Stenosis is a parameter determining the
symmetry in arterial plaque distribution.

The Symmetry Index is defined by: **a** / **b** where **a** is smaller
or equal to than **b**. **a** and **b** are measured in the
reconstructed artery at the position of the minimal luminal diameter.

Possible values of symmetry range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates
complete asymmetry and 1 indicates complete symmetry.

Landmark Based Wall Motion Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compare the quantitative results with those provided by the usual
visual interpretation, the left ventricular boundary is divided into 5
anatomical regions, denoted:

-  Anterobasal.

-  Anterolateral.

-  Posterobasal.

-  Diaphragmatic.

-  Apical.

Quantitative Arterial Analysis Reference Method
-----------------------------------------------

Defined Terms:

-  Computer Calculated Reference.

-  Interpolated Local Reference.

-  Mean Local Reference.

.. _sect_T.4.1:

Computer Calculated Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The computer-defined obstruction analysis calculates the reconstruction
diameter based on the diameters outside the stenotic segment. This
method is completely automated and user independent. The reconstructed
diameter represents the diameters of the artery had the obstruction not
been present.

The proximal and distal borders of the stenotic segment are
automatically calculated.

The difference between the detected contour and the reconstructed
contour inside the reconstructed diameter contour is considered to be
the plaque.

Based on the reconstruction diameter at the Minimum Luminal Diameter
(MLD) position a reference diameter for the obstruction is defined.

.. _sect_T.4.2:

Interpolated Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The interpolated reference obstruction analysis calculates a
reconstruction diameter for each position in the analyzed artery. This
reconstructed diameter represents the diameters of the artery when no
disease would be present. The reconstruction diameter is a line fitted
through at least two user-defined reference markers by linear
interpolation.

By default two references are used at the positions of the reference
markers are automatically positioned at 5% and 95% of the artery length.

To calculate a percentage diameter stenosis the reference diameter for
the obstruction is defined as the reconstructed diameter at the position
of the MLD.

In cases where the proximal and distal part of the analyzed artery have
a stable diameter during the treatment and long-term follow-up, this
method will produce a stable reference diameter for all positions in the
artery.

.. _sect_T.4.3:

Mean Local Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of mean local reference obstruction the reference diameter will
be an average of the diameters at the position of one or more the
reference markers.

This method is particularly appropriate for the analysis of bifurcated
arteries.

.. _sect_T.5:

Positions in Diameter Graphic
-----------------------------

A vessel segment length as seen in the image is not always indicated as
the same X-axis difference in the graph.

The X-axis of the graph is based on pixel positions on the midline and
these points are not necessarily equidistant. This is caused by the fact
that vessels do not only run perfectly horizontally or vertically, but
also at angles.

When a vessel midline is covering a number of pixel positions perfectly
horizontal or vertical, it will cover less space in mm compared to a
vessel that covers the same number of pixel positions under an angle.
When a segment runs perfectly horizontal or vertical, the segment length
is equal to the amount of midline pixel points times the pixel
separation (each point of the midline is separated exactly the pixel
spacing in mm) and the points on the X-axis also represent exactly one
pixel space. This is not the case when the vessel runs under an angle.
For example an artery that is positioned at a 45 angle, the distance
between two points on the midline is 0.7 times the pixel spacing.

As example, the artery consists of 10 elements (n =10); each has a
length of 1mm (pixel size). If the MLD was exactly in the center of the
artery you would expect the length from 0 to the MLD would be 5 sub
segments long, thus 5 mm. This is true if the artery runs horizontal or
vertically (assumed aspect ratio is 1).

If the artery is positioned in a 45º angle then the length of each
element is √2 times the pixel size compared to the previous example.
Thus the length depends on the angle of the artery.
