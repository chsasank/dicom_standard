Worklists (Informative)

Examples For The Usage of The Modality Worklist (Informative)
-------------------------------------------------------------

These typical examples of Modality Worklists are provided for
informational purposes only.

-  A Worklist consisting of Scheduled Procedure Step entities that have
   been scheduled for a certain time period (e.g., "August 9, 1995"),
   and for a certain Scheduled Station AE title (namely the modality,
   where the Scheduled Procedure Step is going to be performed). See
   `figure_title <#figure_DD.1-1>`__.

-  A Worklist consisting of the Scheduled Procedure Step entities that
   have been scheduled for a certain time period (e.g., "August 9,
   1995"), and for a certain Modality type (e.g., CT machines). This is
   a scenario, where scheduling is related to a pool of modality
   resources, and not for a single resource.

-  A Worklist consisting of the Scheduled Procedure Step entities that
   have been scheduled for a certain time period (e.g., "August 9,
   1995"), and for a certain Scheduled Performing Physician. This is a
   scenario, where scheduling is related to human resources and not for
   equipment resources.

-  A Worklist consisting of a single Scheduled Procedure Step entity
   that has been scheduled for a specific Patient. In this scenario, the
   selection of the Scheduled Procedure Step was done beforehand at the
   modality. The rationale to retrieve this specific worklist is to
   convey the most accurate and up-to-date information from the IS,
   right before the Procedure Step is performed.

The Modality Worklist SOP Class User may retrieve additional Attributes.
This may be achieved by Services outside the scope of the Modality
Worklist SOP Class.
