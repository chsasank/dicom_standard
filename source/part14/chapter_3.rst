Definitions
===========

For the purposes of this Standard the following definitions apply.

Characteristic Curve
   The inherent Display Function of a Display System including the
   effects of ambient light. The Characteristic Curve describes
   Luminance versus DDL of an emissive display device, such as a
   CRT/display controller system, or Luminance of light reflected from a
   print medium, or Luminance derived from the measured optical density
   versus DDL of a hard-copy medium and the given Luminance of a
   light-box. The Characteristic Curve depends on operating parameters
   of the Display System.

   .. note::

      The Luminance generated by an emissive display may be measured
      with a photometer. Diffuse optical density of a hard-copy may be
      measured with a densitometer.

Contrast Sensitivity
   characterizes the sensitivity of the average human observer to
   Luminance changes of the Standard Target. Contrast Sensitivity is
   inversely proportional to Threshold Modulation.

Contrast Threshold
   A function that plots the Just-Noticeable Difference divided by the
   Luminance across the Luminance Range.

Digital Driving Level
   A digital value that given as input to a Display System produces a
   Luminance. The set of DDLs of a Display System is all the possible
   discrete values that can produce Luminance values on that Display
   System. The mapping of DDLs to Luminance values for a Display System
   produces the Characteristic Curve of that Display System. The actual
   output for a given DDL is specific to the Display System and is not
   corrected for the Grayscale Standard Display Function.

Display Function
   A function that describes a defined grayscale rendition of a Display
   System, the mapping of the DDLs in a defined space to Luminance,
   including the effects of ambient light at a given state of adjustment
   of the Display System. Distinguished from Characteristic Curve, which
   is the inherent Display Function of a Display System.

Display System
   A device or devices that accept DDLs to produce corresponding
   Luminance values. This includes emissive displays, transmissive
   hardcopy viewed on light boxes, and reflective hardcopy.

Illuminance
   Light from the environment surrounding the Display System that
   illuminates the display medium. It contributes to the Luminance that
   is received by an observer from the image display. Ambient Light
   reduces the contrast in the image.

Just-Noticeable Difference
   The Luminance difference of a given target under given viewing
   conditions that the average human observer can just perceive.

JND Index
   The input value to the Grayscale Standard Display Function, such that
   one step in JND Index results in a Luminance difference that is a
   Just-Noticeable Difference.

Luminance
   is the luminous intensity per unit area projected in a given
   direction. The International System unit (used in PS3.14) is candela
   per square meter (cd/m\ :sup:`2`), which is sometimes called nit.
   Another unit often used is footlambert (fL). 1 fL = 3.426
   cd/m\ :sup:`2`.

Luminance Range
   The span of Luminance values of a Display System from a minimum
   Luminance to a maximum Luminance.

P-Value
   A device independent value defined in a perceptually linear grayscale
   space. The output of the DICOM Presentation LUT is P-Values, i.e.,
   the pixel value after all DICOM defined grayscale transformations
   have been applied. P-Values are the input to a Standardized Display
   System.

Grayscale Standard Display Function
   The mathematically defined mapping of an input JND index to Luminance
   values defined in PS3.14.

Standardized Display System
   A device or devices that produce Luminance values that are related to
   input P-Values by the Grayscale Standard Display Function. How this
   is performed is not defined, though it may be achieved by
   transformation of P-Values into DDLs accepted by a Display System.

Standard Luminance Level
   Any one of the Standard Luminance levels in
   `table_title <#table_B-1>`__.

Standard Target
   A 2-deg x 2-deg square filled with a horizontal or vertical grating
   with sinusoidal modulation of 4 cycles per degree. The square is
   placed in a uniform background of a Luminance equal to the mean
   Luminance of the Target.

   .. note::

      The Standard Target is defined in terms of the subtended viewing
      angle, not in terms of the distance from the viewer to the target.

Threshold Modulation
   The minimum Luminance modulation required by the average human
   observer to detect the Standard Target at a given mean Luminance
   level. The Threshold Modulation corresponds to the Just-Noticeable
   Difference in Luminance of the Standard Target.
