Scope and Field of Application
==============================

PS3.14 specifies a standardized Display Function for display of
grayscale images. It provides examples of methods for measuring the
Characteristic Curve of a particular Display System for the purpose of
either altering the Display System to match the Grayscale Standard
Display Function, or for measuring the conformance of a Display System
to the Grayscale Standard Display Function. Display Systems include such
things as monitors with their associated driving electronics and
printers producing films that are placed on light-boxes or alternators.

PS3.14 is neither a performance nor an image display standard. PS3.14
does not define which Luminance and/or Luminance Range or optical
density range an image presentation device must provide. PS3.14 does not
define how the particular picture element values in a specific imaging
modality are to be presented.

PS3.14 does not specify functions for display of color images, as the
specified function is limited to the display of grayscale images. Color
Display Systems may be calibrated to the Grayscale Standard Display
Function for the purpose of displaying grayscale images. Color images,
whether associated with an ICC Profile or not, may be displayed on
standardized grayscale displays, but there are no normative requirements
for the display of the luminance information in a color image using the
GSDF.
